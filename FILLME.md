## Extra Tests

Write which files contain your extra tests. If you did something extra or
impressive here let me know!

## Extensibility

Briefly explain which files you have to change to introduce a new type of
movement or a new type of action, e.g. move to the first whitespace character or
delete to the front. Hint, if this lists all the files in your project you
should reevaluate you implementation.

## Custom Extension

If you came up with your own extension, properly document it here. Explain its
intended behavior and showcase by example.

## Feedback on the Project 

After working on this thing for such a long time you're allowed to vent in this
section. Tell me what you learned or what you would've liked to learn instead,
etc. This does not count toward your grades at all (positive nor negative).
